          <p>What used to look like a professional in a big expensive studio, can now be a teenager in their bedroom equipped with a laptop and
            a microphone. It’s less about perfection,
            and more about self expression. </p>

        <h6 class="strong">Challenge</h6>
        <p>Since our end of first year project, “The Look Of Sound” we had the idea to extend the functionality of the launchpad we created, to make it more like a looper that would allow you to build your own songs by pressing buttons that would
          trigger loops, separated into rows of drums, bass, chords, melodies, and fx.</p>

        <p>Instead of spending a lot of time on making a physical prototype, knowing it wasn’t where I wanted the project to end, I prototyped it’s functionality on Processing to learn how to code the looping and tempo elements that I knew I would
          need later on in the process.
        </p>

        <h6 class="strong">Our Goals</h6>
        <p>To make music production more accessible for children and young teens. By reducing the learning curve and providing a tool that is intuitive yet affordable.</p>
        <p>Explore the concept of how is "Music is a Playground for Sound."</p>
        <p>Innovate. Experiment. Be playful. Make something WACK.</p>


        <h6 class="strong">Approach</h6>
        <p>I decided to use this project for my entrepreneurship and innovation paper to help learn and explore how this project can be extended beyond just the showcase, and find a place in the world that can marketed as a product that is actually of
          use for an intended target audience.</p>

        <p>Throughout the progression in this paper, I realised what I truly wanted to make, and who I wanted to make it for. I think all this information was subconsciously all there when I decided I wanted to create instruments, and this paper
          brought it to my conscious thoughts.</p>

        <p> For example, I knew I wanted to make this ‘looping launchpad’ last year when I was showing my younger cousin Josh, aged 8, how to use my Akai MPK midi keyboard. I had already assigned sounds to each pad, so all he had to do was press them
          and play around with. He enjoyed this so much, that he asked me if I could get him one for his birthday. Although I could go out and buy him one, I knew this wouldn’t be of any use to him because he didn’t have access to a laptop or a
          digital audio workstation. </p>

        <p>This sparked my idea to create something that would allow him to create music without needing any of that.
